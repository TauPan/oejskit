- make sure there's a way to control MochiKit export mode and reasonable defaults
- more indirection to name browsers, support iexplore8 -> iexplore or starting specific firefox profiles ...
- use some bits of the talk to give more concreteness to the docs
- better error if jstests_setup is wrong/missing bits
- not ideal feedback if we fail to start a browser

- css/styling of the test page contents
- better traceback printing

- different prefix for jstest_suite functions?
