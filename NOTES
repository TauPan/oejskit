- make sure there's a way to control MochiKit export mode and reasonable defaults
- use some bits of the talk to give more concreteness to the docs
- better error if jstests_setup is wrong/missing bits
- consider making a source distribution too

- css/styling of the test page contents
- better traceback printing

- different prefix for jstest_suite functions?
