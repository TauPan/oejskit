jskit
=======

jskit contains infrastructure and in particular a py.test plugin to
enable running tests for JavaScript code inside browsers directly
using py.test as the test driver. Running inside the browsers comes
with some speed cost, on the other hand it means for example the code
is tested against the real-word DOM implementations. 

The approach also enables to write integration tests such that the
JavaScript code is tested against server-side Python code mocked as
necessary. Any server-side framework that can already be exposed
through WSGI (or for which a subset of WSGI can be written to
accommodate the jskit own needs XXX pointer ) can play along.

jskit also contains contain code to help modularizing JavaScript code
which can be used to describe and track dependencies dynamically
during development and that can help resolving them statically when
deploying/packaging.
